## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Generate types from Storyblok components:

```bash
npm run sb:types
```

This pulls components from Storyblok and then generates TypeScript types for them. Make sure you're logged into Storyblok with the Storyblok login command, using the Storyblok Cli.

```bash
storyblok login
```

npm i storyblok -g

space id #142520

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
